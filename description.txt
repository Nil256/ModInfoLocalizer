You don't need to add this mod to references in either case.

= If you are the author of a mod =
You can add localization by creating "description_<Language Code>.txt" in the root directory or "Localization" directory of your mod.
(For example: "description_en-US.txt")
Localized description text file needs to be written with UTF-8.
If there are files named same between the root directory and "Localization" directory, the root one will be prioritized.
You can localize into also a language which is not supported on Terraria.
If you are the author but you're making localization mod separately from the mod, please read following.


= If you are making a localization mod unofficially =
You can localize by Mod.Call.
modInfoLocalizer.Call("Register", string modName, string languageCode, string localizedDescription, int priority = -1);

You can localize into also a language which is not supported on Terraria.

priority cannot be assigned 0, that means official support,
You should assign negative value to priority, positive value allows only when overwrite officical localization for some reason.

For example:

public override void PostSetupContent()
{
    if (ModLoader.TryGetMod("ModInfoLocalizer", out Mod modInfoLocalizer))
    {
        modInfoLocalizer.Call("Register", "SomeMod", "en-US", "Localized into English.\nThis is a example.");
    }
